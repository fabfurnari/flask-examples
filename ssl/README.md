SSL without webserver
=====================

The ssl webapp is a simple proof on how to use flask with ssl as context.
This way you don't need to use it throught a webserver (also if is not reccomandable in production environment).

You need to generate a key and crt (X509) to enable it, you can find examples into the `test_crt` folder (obviously they are not valid).
